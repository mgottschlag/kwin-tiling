# Xservers - local X-server list
#
# This file should contain an entry to start the server on the
# local display; if you have more than one display (not screen),
# you can add entries to the list (one per line).  
# If you also have some X terminals connected which do not support XDMCP,
# you can add them here as well; you will want to leave those terminals
# on and connected to the network, else kdm will have a tougher time
# managing them. Each X terminal line should look like:
#	XTerminalName:0 foreign
#

:0 local @XBINDIR@/X

# For Linux use this one
#:0 local@tty1 @XBINDIR@/X vt7

# For Solaris use this one
#:0 local@console @XBINDIR@/X
