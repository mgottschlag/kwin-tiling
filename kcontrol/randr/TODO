Remaining known issues

General
	Does not yet work with multi-monitor setup using RANDR 1.2 (not tested with legacy RANDR)
	
Qt
	Font sizes on newly started apps after a resolution change are incorrect
		This doesn't appear to happen with non-Xft font rendering, Xft/Qt interaction?

Kwin
	Support different sized virtual desktops

RandR programs
	Support configuring different sized virtual desktops


-------------
RandR1.2 TODO

--> port the legacy interface to share the populate* functions
--> try to merge LegacyRandRConfig and RandRConfig
--> Get relative outputs working
--> Fix the apply/update methods so they actually work correctly
    with the KCModule interface.
--> Clean up the RandR* classes
