*) Network Status kded module implements two interfaces under
/modules/networkstatus

 *) Client provides network status info and signals to network aware
 apps
 *) Service allows apps providing or monitoring network status to
 register their networks and change their status

  Service changes are aggregated and signalled over the Client interface
  to listening apps.

*) Add a KConnectionManager class to make using the Client interface
stupidly easy.  This caches status, preventing unnecessary dbus calls,
allows control over connect/disconnect policy and can call registered
slots on connect/disconnect.

*) Add a NetworkStatusIndicator class which is a simple widget shown
when offline, which automatically hides() itself when online

*) Add a pair of GUI test programs 'client' and 'service' which allow
the curious to simulate network changes and their effects on a client.

To use:

1) make install
2) qdbus org.kde.kded /kded loadModule networkstatus,
   qdbus org.kde.kded /modules/networkstatus status
   qdbus org.kde.kded /modules/networkstatus networks
3) in builddir/tests ./service
4) likewise, ./client
5) Change the service's status and observe the changes in the client.
   Set the client to Start Connect while the service is offline, then
   connect the service and see how the client responds.
6) Use KConnectionManager in your own code.
