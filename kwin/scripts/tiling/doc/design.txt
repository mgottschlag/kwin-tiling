This file is supposed to describe the design and planned development of the
tiling script. What follows is first a list of the goals of the project and then
design decisions and a coarse description of the design.

Goals:
 * A functional tiling window management extension for kwin
 * Automatic layouts should be supported:
   * Spiral layout
   * Two columns/rows
   * Regular grid?
   * ...
 * Different layouts for different desktops/screens
 * A number of different layouts as well as a possibility to disable tiling for
   a certain screen/desktop combination
 * The possibility to make some windows floating (remove them from the layout)
 * Tab groups should be handled correctly (a complete tab group forms one tile)
 * Individual windows should be resizable and the whole layout should be updated
   accordingly
 * Windows should be selected and moved/resized in the layout and between
   screens and desktops using the keyboard
 * Windows should be movable/resizable within the layout using the mouse as well
 * Tiled windows should always be drawn below floating ones
 * Window borders should maybe be reduced (like with maximized windows) when
   being tiled, or should be completely hidden with a shortcut to show the
   title bar of the active window (possibly configurable?)
 * Some windows cannot be tiled properly (dialogs, non resizable windows, etc.),
   those should automatically be made floating

Design decisions:
 * TODO

Design description:
 * TileList: KWin doesn't give us any information about tab groups, so we have
   to figure that out ourselves by setting a property and synchronizing it among
   all clients in a tab. This information needs to be kept up-to-date on tab
   group changes as well. The code related to this is in tilelist.js which
   contains a class which keeps track of all tab groups in the system.
 * Tile: Various window signals (resizing, moving, maximizing etc.) have to be
   reacted to, this class binds handlers to these signals and filters them as
   necessary (e.g. intermediate steps in a resize operation are not interesting
   for us).
 * Layout: This is the class which allocated the areas of the different tiles in
   an automatic fashion. It contains functions to get the top/bottom/left/right
   neighbour of a tile which are used when the user wants to move the focus to
   a different tile. The different kinds of layouts are classes derived from
   this class.
   TODO: Does this class also contain a list of the floating windows, and how is
   focus switching implemented there?
 * Tiling: The main class which contains a list of the current layouts (one per
   screen/desktop combination) and which registers global keyboard shortcuts and
   some global events (e.g. screen count changes).
 * The layout switcher is implemented in QML.
